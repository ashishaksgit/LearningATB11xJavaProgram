import java.util.Scanner;
The Scanner class from the java.util package is imported to take user input.

Class and Main Method
java
Copy
Edit
public class Lab164_2d_Multiplication_Table {
Declares a public class named Lab164_2d_Multiplication_Table.

java
Copy
Edit
public static void main(String[] args) {
The main() method is the entry point of the program.

Creating Scanner Object
java
Copy
Edit
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
Creates a Scanner object to read input from the console.

Taking User Input
java
Copy
Edit
System.out.println("Enter the size");
Displays the message "Enter the size" to prompt the user for input.

java
Copy
Edit
int Size_of_the_Table = scanner.nextInt();
Reads an integer from the user and stores it in the variable Size_of_the_Table.

Nested Loops for Multiplication Table
java
Copy
Edit
for (int i = 0; i < Size_of_the_Table; i++) {
Outer loop runs from 0 to (Size_of_the_Table - 1).

i represents the row index.

java
Copy
Edit
for (int j = 0; j < Size_of_the_Table; j++) {
Inner loop runs from 0 to (Size_of_the_Table - 1).

j represents the column index.

java
Copy
Edit
System.out.print((i * j) + "\t");
Calculates the product of i * j and prints it, separated by a tab (\t).

java
Copy
Edit
System.out.println();
Moves to the next line after printing all columns for a row.

Debugging and Fixes
Scanner Leak:

The Scanner object should be closed after use to prevent resource leaks.

Fix: Add scanner.close(); after taking input.

Better Formatting:

The output should look like a proper multiplication table.

The first row and column should display numbers properly.

Variable Naming Convention:

Java follows camelCase for variable names.

Fix: Rename Size_of_the_Table → sizeOfTable.

Fixed and Improved Code
java
Copy
Edit
package ex_16_Arrays;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Lab164_2d_Multiplication_Table {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the size: ");
        int sizeOfTable = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();  // Fix: Close scanner

        // Print column headers
        System.out.print("\t");
        for (int j = 0; j < sizeOfTable; j++) {
            System.out.print(j + "\t");
        }
        System.out.println();

        // Generate multiplication table
        for (int i = 0; i < sizeOfTable; i++) {
            System.out.print(i + "\t");  // Print row header
            for (int j = 0; j < sizeOfTable; j++) {
                System.out.print((i * j) + "\t");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }

Logic of the Multiplication Table Program
This program generates a multiplication table of size N × N, where N is provided by the user. It follows a nested loop approach to construct the table.

Step-by-Step Logic
Take user input (sizeOfTable)

The user is prompted to enter a number (N), which defines the size of the multiplication table.

This determines how many rows and columns the table will have.

Print column headers

The first row prints numbers from 0 to N-1 to indicate the column headers.

Nested loops to generate the table

The outer loop iterates over the rows (i from 0 to N-1).

The inner loop iterates over the columns (j from 0 to N-1).

Each element in the table is calculated as i * j.

Printing in tabular format

The first column of each row prints the row number (to act as a row header).

Each value is separated by a tab (\t) for proper spacing.

A System.out.println(); ensures that after each row, the cursor moves to the next line.

Breaking Down the Output Generation
Let’s assume the user enters 5 (sizeOfTable = 5).

Step 1: Print Column Headers
markdown
Copy
Edit
    0   1   2   3   4
The first row represents the column headers.

Step 2: Outer Loop - Generating Rows
The outer loop runs from i = 0 to i = 4, representing each row.

Step 3: Inner Loop - Generating Columns
For each row i, the inner loop runs from j = 0 to j = 4, printing the multiplication results.

i	j	i * j
0	0	0 × 0 = 0
0	1	0 × 1 = 0
0	2	0 × 2 = 0
0	3	0 × 3 = 0
0	4	0 × 4 = 0
This forms the first row: 0 0 0 0 0

For i = 1:

i	j	i * j
1	0	1 × 0 = 0
1	1	1 × 1 = 1
1	2	1 × 2 = 2
1	3	1 × 3 = 3
1	4	1 × 4 = 4
This forms the second row: 1 0 1 2 3 4

For i = 2:

i	j	i * j
2	0	2 × 0 = 0
2	1	2 × 1 = 2
2	2	2 × 2 = 4
2	3	2 × 3 = 6
2	4	2 × 4 = 8
This forms the third row: 2 0 2 4 6 8

Similarly, this pattern continues for all i values.

Final Output Structure
If sizeOfTable = 5, the program prints:

	0	1	2	3	4
0	0	0	0	0	0
1	0	1	2	3	4
2	0	2	4	6	8
3	0	3	6	9	12
4	0	4	8	12	16
Key Observations
✅ The first row and first column represent numbers.
✅ The remaining cells contain multiplication results (i * j).
✅ Proper formatting ensures readability.

Time Complexity Analysis
Outer loop: Runs N times.

Inner loop: Runs N times for each outer loop iteration.

Total iterations = N × N → O(N²) (quadratic complexity).

Thus, the program is efficient for small values of N but may slow down for very large N (e.g., N = 1000).

Summary
✔ User Input: The table size (N).
✔ Nested Loops: Generate multiplication results (i * j).
✔ Formatted Output: Properly structured multiplication table.
✔ Time Complexity: O(N²) due to nested loops.
